    How to create an HTML tag: <tag attribute="value">Content</tag>
    <tag attribute="value" /> -> autoclosed tag

    <h1>Trachea<h1>
    
        <h2>Bronchial tube</h2>
        <h3>Bronchiole</h3>

        ...
    <div>
    <h> - title and subtitles
    h1 - Browser and google look for the h1 to show the page
    h2 - h6 -> subtitles // order of importance
    Dont jump from an h1 to an h3-4 -> go to h2
    <p> - paragraph / Text that is not title or subtitle (for now)
    <span> -> to style parts of our text (they are usually enclosed in a text tag)
    <a href="anydomain/anyrelativepath"> - link (href specifigc attribute)
    <div> -> non semantic grouping tag (it can contain other tags inside)

    SEMANTIC GROUPING TAGS
    <section>
    <header> -> on the top, the presentation of the website
    <aside> -> left side - either a nav or some information not that relevant to website
    <main> -> page information
    <aside> -> right side
    <footer> -> on the bottom with links outside the website and company description and address
    <nav> -> usually all the links throughout the website
    <article> -> cards, advertisments
    

    <section>
        <h2></h2>
            <section class="subsection">
                <h3></h3>
                    <section class="subsubsection">
                        <h4></h4>
                    </section>
            </section>
    <section>
    <section>
    <h2>
        <section class="subsection">
            <h3></h3>
                <section class="subsubsection">
                    <h4></h4>
                </section>
        </section>

   HTML Notes:
    Hypertext Markup Language: 
    It's a markup language, not a programming language. It doesn't follow programming languages rules.
    What does it mean to "mark"? Websites need to be understood and interpreted by machines, software and computers in adition to people. So, in order to create a graphical piece that's going to be only visual for us, it has to be understood by a machine as well. For it to be done, we have to technically mark the different content parts of a website.
    We use tags as the language pieces to mark up the different parts and concepts in the website.

    ----------------------
    Minimal code for a HTML file:
    -IT ALWAYS HAS TO START WITH THE HTML TAG-

    <!DOCTYPE html> -> defines we are using HTML5 and we are going to use the latest tags
    <html> -> defines starting and ending point of the document
        <head> </head> -> website information (user doesn't see it)
        <body> </body> -> website content (user can see it)
    </html>

    <head>
    <meta charset= “utf-8”> -> website encription depending on the symbol language to be read by the website
    </head>

    ----------------------
    Every open tag has to be closed. Some of them are closed at the same time they are opened.
    For example: <br/> o <hr/>  -> they don't have content (that's why)
    
    They are different than the ones that have content: <p>Content</p>
    
    ----------------------
     UNIVERSAL ATTRIBUTES HTML (ALL TAGS)
        id -> one by project and tag (it's almost never used)
        class -> can be used multiple times and can be repeated, repetition is used to set special styles
        style -> inline style only applicable to that particular tag
        name -> specific name
        --------------
        CSS - Cascade stylesheet
        
        SYNTAXIS
        tag {
            style-name: value;
        }
        .class {
            style-name: value;
        }
        #id {
            style-name: value;
        }
        -------------------
        strong -> bold with semantic meaning
        b -> bold without semantic meaning
        em -> italics with semantic meaning
        i -> italics without semantic meaning
        hr -> divisor line
        br -> vertical space

        -----------------------
        RELATIVE UNIT
        em -> relative to the parent (not very used)
        rem -> relative to the root (which is the browser, which is the screen size)
        % -> relative to the parent

        ABSOLUTE UNITS
        px -> most used
       ------------------------
